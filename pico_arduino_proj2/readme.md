## Project 2  ADC Photoresistor ##
This project reads ambient light using a photoresistor (LDR) in a voltage divider and the Pico’s 12-bit SAR ADC. The divider is wired:
3V3 → LDR → (junction) → 10 kΩ → GND, with the junction at GP26 (ADC). 
A sample is taken every 100 ms, converted to volts, printed over the USB CDC serial port at 115200 baud, and compared to a threshold to drive an LED. 

# Description #
This project uses a pi pico, GL552 LDR photoresistor, and a standard LED. This design is intended to light the LED bulb if the photoresistor lacks a light source. This is done by assigning the code generated by ADC to a new value every 100ms. The ADC code is dependent on the lightsource, as photoresistors have higher resistance in darkness. As the resistance of a photoresistor increases with darkness, the Vin measured by ADC is also lowered. 

There are adjustable variables, volts, reference voltage, ADC max, and the threshold set. 

code = floor(Vin/Vref)*(2n-1)  // code from voltage.
V = code*(Vref/(2n-1)) // voltage estimate from code.  

These equations are where volts are calculated from, being about 1.6V. Then comes the reference voltage of 3.3V from the pi pico. ADC max being the value of (2^n -1), n=12 since the pi pico is 12-bit. The ADC uses a successive-approximation (SAR) binary search with a comparator and an internal DAC. The threshold 

Threshold = V/(Vref*ADCmax). 
The setup begins by serializing the pico and waiting for it to do so, after, bit depth and the LED pin is output. Within the loop, the code from ADC is converted to write to the terminal the values of voltage and converted ADC code, as variables volts and raw. There is a condition where if raw is less than 1000, the LED is to turn on until raw is over 1000 again when exposed to light. 

# Current Behavior: #
Samples every ~100 ms
Prints: raw=<0..4095> and V=<volts>
Turns the LED on in darkness when raw < THRESH_RAW (lower junction voltage)

# Improvements (optional): #
Hysteresis to prevent flicker near the threshold (use THRESH_LOW and THRESH_HIGH).
Smoothing with an exponential moving average to reduce noise.
Auto-calibration: learn min/max raw values in your environment and map to 0–255 PWM if you want a dimming output later.
